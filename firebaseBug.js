The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the database rules are too restrictive or incorrectly configured. For example, if the rules prevent a user from reading data, even if they have the correct authentication credentials, the app will fail.  This can be difficult to debug because it may not immediately indicate a database rules issue, instead appearing as a general network error or an unexpected empty result.
